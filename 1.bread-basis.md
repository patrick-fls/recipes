## Measuring

You will not find any recipes in cups, teaspoon or tablespoon here. Everything is in grams.
The problem is that 1 cup of flour can have a very different weight in the same volume.
A balance is mandatory, you can find cheap ones going down the the 10th of a gram, which is perfect to measure yeast or sodium carbonate.

## Baker's percentage
all recipes are express in baker's percentage, meaning how much percent water, salt or yeast in terms of flour.
For example, you'll see the following:
- Flour 500g (100%)
- Water 300g (60%)
- Salt 10g (2%)
- Yeast 2g (0.4%)

You can adapt the quantity of each recipes by modifying the quantity of flour and adapting the rest according to their percentages.

## Flour Type
In North America it's harder to find the good grade of flour than in Europe (specifically France and Italy).
It's important to have enough protein in the flour to make a good, aerated bread. This leads us on desiring Hard Wheat flours.

In north america, you can readily find the following:
- Cake flour (forget about it)
- All Purpose flour (highly dependant on brand...)
- Bread flour (your best bet)
- Whole wheat (Have a bag small bag ready)

A note on Whole wheat: make sure to use it and not keep it for too long, the taste goes rancid quicker than white flour.

## Hydration
The hydration of the dough will define the type of bread you're making. The lower the hydration, the harder the dough will be to work with.
Here is a table to give you an idea:

| Hydration % | Dough type|
|-------------|-----------|
|30-50 | Pasta, like Ramen noodles |
|50-55 | Bretzels, bagels, pita |
|55-65 | Dense breads such as white bread, challah|
|65-75|These are the rustic bread, Our main interest. Pizza, Baguette, Ciabatta, Pain de campagne all these are in this hydration range |

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Hydration will vary depending on your flour. Some flour will require a 65% hydration when another flour would require 55%. The difference can be quite dramatic. You can experiment, you'll see that whole wheat needs a lot more for the same texture for example. If the texture is not what you expect, play with the hydration level.

## Time and Temperature

There is one thing you cannot rush, and that's time. The flavour does not come from the yeast (in fact all commercial yeasts are basically the same) it comes from ... basically rotting! A bread you let ferment overnight will be infinitely better than a bread you cook immediately. You really cannot rush this. If you ever create your sourdough, you'll see this process live!

Temperature is also important. It will accelerate the process (to a degree - pardon the pun!) but it can't be too hot. If your kitchen is cold, it will take longer. If you live in a warmer climate it will be faster. Experimentation is required to find the sweet spot.


## Autolyse

Autolyse is the step to fully hydrate the flour before kneading it, typically 20 to 40 minutes depending of the type of flour used (bleached flour will require less time, whole wheat more)
It has [numerous benefits](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2017/09/29/using-the-autolyse-method) and is used through out these recipes.
